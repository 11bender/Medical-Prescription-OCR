Objective :
The objective here is to let allow a doctor to write his prescriptions the conventional way (i.e., using their pen and paper). From the scanned version of the prescription, a handwritten character recognition will be followed to capture the data (name of the patient, symptoms, findings, prescription of medicine, tests, advice, etc.) written by the doctor. Since,   the accuracy rate of the state-of-the-art hand written character reorganization is not still up to the acceptable level, we propose to apply an error correction mechanism to reduce the errors. The solution does not oppose the age-old convention and affordable as it is mostly a software solution with a minimum hardware requirement.
